**Version Namimg**
Commit names are as follows: lowercase **v** succeded by the first (major change), the second (medium change) and the last (small change) numbers (ex: v1.3.5).

The commit names following an update are assigned by the scale of the changes and how they affect the user experience. It's up to the developer to chose how an update may have an impact on the UI & UX.

**Pushing/Pulling**

The owners have the right to restore the website to any version they consider and can accept or decline push/pull requests.

**Expected behavior**
Contributors should respect the naming of classes, IDs ecc. to ensure that others can understand and reproduce any given line of code with ease.
